## Webpack Starter Kit

Now try to commit something and push it up to your new repo. If everything is setup correctly, you should see the changes on GitHub.

## Setup

After one person has gone through the steps of cloning down this repo and editing the remote, everyone should clone down the repo. 

Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a page with some `h1` text and a pink background. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## How to View Your Code in Action

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view your code running in the browser.

## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For instance: `box-test.js`.

## Running Your Tests

Run your test suite using the command:

```bash
npm test
```

The test results will output to the terminal.

## Webpack?

If you look in the `package.json` file, you'll see one of the library dependencies called `webpack`. If you're interested in learning more about what Webpack is and how it works behind the scenes, take a look through the [Webpack configuration documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
