## Summary:

Wheel of Death is a comedic take on the classic game, Wheel of Fortune. In this application a user can compete against two other players to solves a mystery phrase. The game begins with the first playing spinning the wheel and guessing a consonant in the puzzle. Dependant on the outcome of the player's guess, they can then choose to spin again or buy a vowel. Each player continues with their turn until they guess an incorrect vowel or consonant. The round is concluded when one of the players correctly solves the puzzle. The game is made up of four rounds and the winner is determined by the player with the largest grand total score at the conclusion of the fourth round.

The goals of this project include practicing OOP design, developing good practices with GitHub collaboration and workflow, and building out a robust test suite that also tests all functionality of the client-side application.
